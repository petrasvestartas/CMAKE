### Part 1/3 Create File "CMakeLists.txt"

``` cmake

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)

# this is the whole project name, after name there are multiple options
project(myproject LANGUAGES CXX)

# include subproject in project "myproject" named "my_exe", where file "main.cpp" will be aƒèded
# header files are referenced automatically, but you need to include source files
add_executable(my_exe main.cpp math.cpp)

# print a message
message("Hello World from CMakeLists!")


```

### Part 2/3 Create File "main.cpp math.hpp math.cpp"

main.cpp
``` cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "math.hpp"

int main(int argc, char **argv){
 std::cout << "Hi \n";
 std::cout << "Call sum function from header: " << sum(2,3) << "\n";
 return 0;
}

```

math.hpp
``` hpp
#pragma once
int sum(int a, int b);
```

math.cpp
``` cpp
#include "math.hpp"
int sum(int a, int b){
 return a+b;
}
```

### Part 3/3 Bash Commands - Configure and Generate


Be sure to be in the folder where the file is "main.cpp" 

Create directory, before you start
```
mkdir build
cd build
```


Option 1 - Configure and Generate using default compiler 
two dots means you are in build folder and CMakeLists.txt is in the previous one including source files
one dot means that CMakeLists.txt and source files are in build folder
```
cmake .. 
```

Option 2 - Configure and Generate using Visual Studio compiler
https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html
https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/generator/Visual%20Studio%2017%202022.html
Other compilers: mingw, ninja
```
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ..
```
 
Build the generated project e.g. in dir C:\Test\build
```
cmake --build .
```

Run the executable C:\Test\build\Debug
```
Debug\my_exe
```

Remove folders and files, be one directory back, outside the folder
```
rmdir build /S /Q
```
